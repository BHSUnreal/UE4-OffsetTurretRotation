# UE4-OffsetTurretRotation

This project shows how to rotate a turret with an offset aim joint. It was created in response to this thread: [Aiming a turret (Math question)](https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?151040-Aiming-a-turret-(Math-question))

For a mathematical explanation, see: [CalculatingPitch.pdf](https://github.com/Konokai/UE4-OffsetTurretRotation/blob/master/CalculatingPitch.pdf)

The interesting code can be found in [TurretRotationFunctionLibrary.h](https://github.com/Konokai/UE4-OffsetTurretRotation/blob/master/Source/TurretRotation/TurretRotationFunctionLibrary.h) and [TurretRotationFunctionLibrary.cpp](https://github.com/Konokai/UE4-OffsetTurretRotation/blob/master/Source/TurretRotation/TurretRotationFunctionLibrary.cpp)
